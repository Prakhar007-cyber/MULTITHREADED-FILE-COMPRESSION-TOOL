DESCRIPTION:

*This C++ application implements parallel file compression/decompression using zlib and thread pools. The tool features a console interface supporting both individual files and batch directory processing, with adjustable compression levels (0-9) and configurable worker threads. Its benchmark mode quantitatively demonstrates performance gains from multithreading by comparing single-threaded versus multi-threaded execution times on standardized test data. The architecture combines stream-based file I/O with thread-safe task distribution, implementing proper mutex locking for output operations. Users can observe real-time progress updates as files are processed, with detailed metrics including compression ratios and throughput rates. The implementation serves as both a practical utility and an educational demonstration of concurrent programming patterns in modern C++.*
